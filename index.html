        <a> Most recipes will call for 6 oz tomato paste. In my experience, it makes the sauce much more acidic than necessary.
        The ingredients in this recipe are really all that's gonna flavor the sauce. Oregano is the main sweetener for any sauce
        don't ever use any kind of sugar or sugary substance (honey) for tomato sauce. </a>
        
        <a>You can simmer this for as long as you'd like. For best flavor, if you have a blender (immersion blender will do too) 
            I recommend putting the onions in the sauce halved, whole garlic cloves, whole basil leafs, and hold off on the oregano until you're done simmering/cooking.
